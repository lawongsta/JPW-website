                          This is a new and wonderful method to restore missing teeth. It is much more conservative and does not require adjacent teeth to be touched as is the case for bridgework; they can even be used to replace removable partial and full dentures with permanently anchored partial or full arch bridgework. You'll never have to take your dental work in and out of your mouth again.

                          Almost all hypersensitive or abscessed teeth may be saved by Root Canal Therapy. Unfortunately, there are also many horror stories indicating the root canal process was worse than the original toothache. There have been many innovations in this field which have made the process more comfortable and easier on the patient. This is the preferred method for saving these teeth instead of extraction, and they can usually be finished in one appointment. It is much less expensive and less complex to save a tooth than to replace it with a bridge or an implant; there is no better anchor than your own tooth.

                          Gum disease is a progressive process which causes the loss of anchoring bone which results in loss of teeth. Initial symptoms may begin with bleeding, sore, or puffy gums. It usually progresses unnoticed until there is more bleeding, bad breath and loose teeth. At this time the unchecked disease may result in tooth loss. We can intercede in the process and may even stop the disease. We treat minor to moderate gum disease using comfortable and painless methods which have proven very successful. Let us get you back on the path to dental health.
